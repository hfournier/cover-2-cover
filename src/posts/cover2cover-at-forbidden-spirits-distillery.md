Summer 2021 brings more live music performances for Cover2Cover.

August 13 and September 17 we will play from 6pm-8pm at Forbidden Spirits nestled in the hills located in East Kelowna only 15 minutes from downtown.

A large patio lounge and picnic area can provide room for everyone. We are excited to play at this beautiful venue and look forward to seeing some familiar faces there!
