For the second time this year, **Cover2Cover**, Kelowna's classic rock dance band has sold out the Mission Hall. More than 250 people came to the event ready to dance to their favourite classic rock songs. The dance floor was full ALL NIGHT LONG and the fundraiser exceeded all expectations of the organizer. There are plans to make this a regularly occuring event in Kelowna as the feedback from several guests is that there are very few events in Kelowna where people can dance to songs from the 1970s and 1980s.

Lead singer Jim Rhindress was very happy with how the evening went as he and fellow bandmates Julie Masi, Mike Mueller, Mike Kleineberg and Ken Pendleton rocked the room for more than 3 hours until midnight and never once was the dance floor not full! "This is the kind of event we love!"Jim said, "An intimate setting and a very appreciative and enthusiastic crowd. We can't wait to play it again!"
