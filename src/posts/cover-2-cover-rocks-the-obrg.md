On June 20, the members of the Okanagan Business Referral Group (OBRG) in Kelowna celebrated their end of year event with a rockin' dance party. **Cover2Cover** showed up in a BIG way and rocked their room with classic rock songs for over 3 hours.

There were people up on their feet dancing all night long... even Brian's wife who was on crutches after her hip replacement surgery. She couldn't sit still :)

A fantastic evening and thank you so much to Kim Foreman of Kelowna Voice Lab for making it all happen and inviting us to play!
