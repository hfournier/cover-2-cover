It's been a very busy December full of awesome classic rock music for corporate private Christmas parties. New Years Eve, we played the Mission Hall party for the third year in a row and the crowd was amazing!

What a great night! The dance music started at 9:00 and didn't stop until after 1:00! Jim's guitar was on fire, Mike's solos were stellar, Mike's bass was setting the groove and Ken's drumming was tighter than ever.

It was such a fun night, we will post a few videos online.
