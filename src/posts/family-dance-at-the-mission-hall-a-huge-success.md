Organizers of the OKM Family Dance were thrilled to have such a successful dance on Saturday night when **Cover2Cover** ROCKED the Mission Hall with classic rock and country music.

Several hundred people showed up to line dance, rock and party from 7-10pm to some fantastic classic rock and country tunes performed by **Cover2Cover**. One gentleman told an organizer that the music was so great, he kept forgetting it was a live band and not a recording! High praise for us and we were thrilled to help OKM raise so much money to help out kids in Costa Rica.

We look forward to performing with this great group of people again in 2015!
