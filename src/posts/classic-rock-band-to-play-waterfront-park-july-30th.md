**Cover2Cover** will be playing on July 30th at Waterfront Park as part of the Kelowna Parks Alive concert series. Come out and hear Jim Rhindress, Julie Masi, Mike Kleineberg, Dan Marcelino and Mike Mueller perform your favourite classic rock songs that will get you up on your feet dancing.

We are in the process of working on new rock and contemporary songs as well - ones we know will be come classics to appeal to those who like a wide variety. As musicians, we love learning new songs, especially songs that will fill a dance floor.

If you have a favourite classic rock or dance song you'd like to hear, just give us a call or send us an email and make a request. You just might hear your favourite song the next time we play!
