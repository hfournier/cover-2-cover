WE did it!!! Many thanks to our good friend Deb Toye and her team of volunteers for organizing this great event! Over 100 people came out to dance the night away to great classic rock music with **Cover2Cover** Kelowna. Our costume dance was a huge success with silent auction items, a fun photo booth and a live auction of an electric guitar made by JR Guitar.

Everyone had a fantastic time and raised $3400.00 for the Okanagan Food Bank.

It was a great event and we are inspired to keep playing for charities that help our town.

Our next dance will be April 24 at The Corral to benefit the Kelowna Women's Shelter. Stay tuned for details!
