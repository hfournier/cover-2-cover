It's been a busy summer for classic rock and dance band music and **Cover2Cover** has been busy playing for Parks Alive and Westside Days with back-to-back shows in Kelowna and West Kelowna.

Thursday, July 11 **Cover2Cover** set up and played for Parks Alive in City Park. The night was beautiful although definitely a little windy. We played a 45-minute set of fun classic rock music that really emphasized our harmony vocals. Some highlights were captured and put on our Youtube channel.

The very next night, we were headlining at Westside Days in West Kelowna. We loved the stage set-up and were so happy to see hundreds of people out for our set. Many thanks to all of the great folks who filmed clips and put them up on Facebook! Greatly appreciated to see that live music and classic rock is still so appreciated!

Next up - we are playing some backyard parties, taking some holidays and will be practicing some new classic rock songs to play a Halloween Dance October 26. Stay tuned for more details on that!
