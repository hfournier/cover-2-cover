Last night, **Cover2Cover** rocked the room for the Nature's Trust of BC annual Earth Wind Fire 2015 event at the Delta Grand. This annual event raises big money to help protect and keep BC beautiful.

For the 4th year in a row, **Cover2Cover** closed the night by providing classic rock tunes for fundraisers and party goers to rock the night away. Playing at The Delta Grand is always a great time as the sound system is killer, the staff are great to work with and the load in/load out is a breeze.

Jim, Mike, Mike, Ken and Julie covered some classic favourites and added some great new material from Golden Earring, Styx, The Pretenders and The Rolling Stones.

As always, a total pleasure to play for such a great cause and such a great crowd.
