### SINGING FOR THEIR SUPPER

**Cover2Cover Plays For The Food Bank**

Kelowna, B.C. - Well known local classic rock band **Cover2Cover** is putting their money where their microphones are to help The Central Okanagan Food Bank.

“A Night At The Movies” Costume Dance takes place right before Halloween on October 26, 2019 at the Ukrainian Church Hall at 1091 Coronation Avenue in downtown Kelowna.

The Hollywood-themed event promises to be a night to remember and includes a full night of classic rock music, prizes for best costumes, a live auction of an electric guitar made by JR Guitar, a Red Carpet-style photo booth, silent auction and free popcorn and movie candy treats. Additionally, two types of chilli (meat and vegetarian) will be available for purchase plus beer, wine, cider, sodas and water.

“When we were looking for a charity to support, The Food Bank was a natural choice as the need is unfortunately so great here. Kelowna tends to be perceived as a wealthy city and we were shocked to learn 4,000 families in our community rely on the Food Bank every month,” says **Cover2Cover** band member Kim Rhindress.

“The Food Bank is a cause absolutely everyone can get behind,” agrees **Cover2Cover** lead guitarist and founder Jim Rhindress. “We love bringing people together to enjoy great live music, and to do it on behalf of such a worthy organization that does so much good in our community is truly a bonus!”

The Hollywood-themed fun gets started at 8 pm for this 19+ event. Tickets are $25.00 advance purchase or $35.00 at the door. Phone Jim Rhindress at 250.317.5233 or go to www.cover2coverkelowna.com to buy your tickets online.
