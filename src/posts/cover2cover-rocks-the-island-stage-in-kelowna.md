After 18 months of shut down, live music in Kelowna roared back to life Wednesday, July 7 with the first large concert since 2019.

More than 300 people gathered at the Island Stage in Waterfront to hear three hours of live music sponsored by the Parks Alive program in Kelowna.

The Tree Huggers opened, followed by Sad Tom and the Noodles with Cover2Cover closing out the night with a full hour of classic rock.

The crowd sang, danced and cheered along to songs from The Eagles, Heart, Aerosmith, Vince Gill, Pat Benatar and The Rolling Stones to name just a few.

The weather had threatened rain but we were so lucky it cleared up in time for the classic rock show to go on and Cover2Cover was more than ready to take the stage!

Many thanks to photographer Richard Nagy for these fantastic photos and to local videographer Annie Zed for her multiple videos posted on YouTube (linked to elsewhere on our Cover2CoverKelowna website).
