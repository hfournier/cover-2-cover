Fall wine festivals are a big part of what brings tourists and locals alike out to taste the very best our beautiful Okanagan Valley has to offer and Cover2Cover is delighted to bring some classic rock dance music to the party.

Saturday, October 9 the fun begins at the Rotary Centre of the Arts with **Cover2Cover**, Kelowna's Rock Dance Band taking the stage at 7:00pm. The band will be playing all your favourite classic rock tunes with a great new selection of songs from the 80s added in.

Expect to hear great harmonies to rock and country dance songs from The Eagles, Pat Benatar, Heart, The Doobie Brothers and Vince Gill. You'll dance the night away as you sip your favourite wines.

Tickets are $105 and always sell out so be sure to order yours well in advance.
