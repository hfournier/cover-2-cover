        <h1>About Cover2Cover</h1>
        <p>
          Live music makes every event better! Cover2Cover - Kelowna's classic
          rock dance band was formed in 2010 and is the brain child of guitarist
          Jim Rhindress who wanted to create a rock band with the very best
          players Kelowna has to offer. He wanted a fun classic rock dance band
          that would not only have the highest level of musicianship but to
          create a project with great friends who truly enjoy each other's
          company. You can really feel the energy when these good friends get
          together to make great music! They take turns fronting the songs,
          harmonizing and have a ton of fun doing it!
        </p>
        <p>
          Cover2Cover specializes in songs from the 60s, 70s, 80s and 90s
          through today with new material being added all the time. We can also
          perform as a 3-piece or duo depending on the needs of the event.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our sound system is state of the art and we can provide full stage
          lighting if needed. We are available for fundraisers, corporate

          is an acoustic and dance music duo I have formed with my wife, Kim
          Foreman-Rhindress.
        </p>
        <p>
          We sing a wide variety of acoustic and rock songs. Our repertoire is
          perfect for any weddings, wineries, corporate functions, or private
          parties. I play electric guitar, Kim plays keys, and we use backing
          tracks for the bass and drums. We guarantee you a great night of dance
          music, classic rock, and 80s & 90s pop songs.
        </p>
        <p>
          For special occasions like birthdays, anniversaries, or weddings, we
          can write customs songs. And, we can even deliver a singing telegram.
        </p>
