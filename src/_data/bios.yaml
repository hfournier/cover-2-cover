      "Robert started playing in Alberta as a teenager and although they
      may have been tormented, his parents were always very supportive.
      Cutting his teeth in the Alberta scene as an underage drummer was
      never a problem,  he had the best fake ID possible! In 1998 family ties, a
      willing wife, and a desire to live in paradise finally brought him to the
      Okanagan. Since then he has played in numerous bands and has gotten to
      know a lot of great musicians. He is excited to add his lead and harmony
      vocals as well as holding the groove."
